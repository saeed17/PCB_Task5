# PCB_Task5
PCB or the printed circuit board, one of the tools that change the electronics industry. Moreover, this technology provides various advantages such as the lightweight, easy to maintenance and manufactured. The PCB expand in all the industry fields that need electronics components like military, medical, and commercial. 

#PCB Material
 PCB is made of fiberglass and plastic. On the other hand,  components of the PCB printed values or non-printed components depend on the manufactured.  
In this task, we will build a voltage regulation circuit in a PCB module using proteus. Our circuit contains 7805, a resistor, two capacitors, battery. This task aims to discover the PCB design industry and give an introduction to use simulator software for building PCB circuit
